# My wordle clone

This is a clone of the official game by [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)

It is based on [this youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wak7iN4JZzU) by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified)

It also uses the official Wordle [logo](https://www.nytimes.com/games-assets/v2/metadata/wordle-favicon.ico)

I'm going to actively update this clone in the coming weeks, so follow me on [GitHub](https://github.com/souvlaki42) to stay tuned for that

Thanks for reading this and playing this game!
